/* A Caesar Cipher is a method of encoding a message by shifting each character by the same number of letters.
 * For example, with a shift of 5, ‘A’ would encode to ‘F’. In your main method, display a menu to ask the user if
 * they want to encode or decode a phrase. Then ask the user for their shift value. The shift does not need to be
 * less than 26 but does need to be nonnegative. Assume that all messages will be uppercase only.
 * Your program must begin with a menu asking the user if they want to encode or decode a String.
 * It will be easier for you if you have two separate Scanner objects, one that deals with String input and the
 * other that deals with int input.
 * 
 * public static String encode(String str, int shift)
 *     This method takes a String and an int as parameters and returns a String, where each of the characters in the original has been shifted shift number of characters.
 * public static String decode(String str, int shift)
 *     This method takes a String and an int as parameters and returns a String, where each of the characters in the original has been shifted -shift number of characters.
 * 
 * This project will be graded on
 * 
 * 1. Documentation (4 points): Your code must be fully commented and employ standard Java-style conventions.
 * 2. User-Friendliness (4 points): All interactions with the user must be clear and unambiguous.
 * 3. Methods (8 points): Each method has the proper signature and works as expected.
 * 
 * TOTAL: 16 points
