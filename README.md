# My Intro To Java Files

I'm uploading my files for java. Maybe someday I'll write the READMEs.
This is proof I didn't just copy paste all my code, I guess.

I'm PatheticMustan, patheticmustan@gmail.com, Natsumi#0637, all of those are probably me. I have a keybase account that does in fact verify that I am me. It should be right [here](https://gist.github.com/PatheticMustan/69c6b7786177d79843d56f956f0649d1).

## TODO
* Document all the lessons, and add README's because those look pretty.
    - [Q1](https://github.com/PatheticMustan/Intro-To-Java-Files/tree/master/Q1/Lessons)
    - [Q2](https://github.com/PatheticMustan/Intro-To-Java-Files/tree/master/Q2/Lessons)

* Document Project #1, because that's pretty important.
    - [Project 1](https://github.com/PatheticMustan/Intro-To-Java-Files/tree/master/Q2/Projects/Project%20List%20%231)

* Show what grade I got for each project, and apply fixes.
    - Honestly the only reason I got a B- in the first quarter was all because of this dumb card-sorting project that didn't even use Java. I got a 12/24 because I didn't do enough card sorting fast enough. Still salty about that one.

* Document all the lessons/projects up to Q4, what a backlog.

## Finished Tasks
* Standardize UTF-8 and 4 Spaces on all my files.
    - This was pretty painful.

* Fix any corrupted files so that they actually work.
    - Lesson 10 was corrupted because I yoinked the USB out of the computer before it finished saving. I really don't want to have to eject the USB everytime, you know?

* Organize folders into a somewhat organized fashion.
    - Ha, you should see some repositories, it was actually just strewn everywhere. I organized it, which is cool I guess.
