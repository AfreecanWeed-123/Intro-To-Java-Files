/* ValidUsername.java            by Kevin Wang
 *
 * On a certain network, usernames are required to start with the letter ‘U’,
 * and be more than 6 characters in length.
 * Write a program that takes a prospective username (a String) as input,
 * and determines if the String meets the network’s username requirements.
 * 
 * Your code should advise the user if their username choice is illegal, and the reason.
 * (Note: You must instantiate the Scanner object!!)
