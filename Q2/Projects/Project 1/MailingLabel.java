/* MailingLabel.java            by Kevin Wang
 *     (MailingLabel) 26 POINTS
 *         A delimited string is a string literal that contains special characters ("delimiters") to signify a separation between different
 *         elements of information. An example of this is a Microsoft Excel CSV (Comma Separated Values) file.
 *         Write a Java program that performs the following tasks:
 *             * Asks the user to input their chosen delimiter
 *             * Asks the user to input the delimited string, which holds a personâ€™s name and address, as input
 *             * Prints a mailing label as output.
 * 
 *     Sample: Input: "Jose Reyes:13-07 Estates Lane:Bayside, NY 11360"
 *     Output (may be through the Console window):
 *         -----------------------
 *         Jose Reyes
 *         13-07 Estates Lane
 *         Bayside, NY 11360
 *         -----------------------
 *     Your program must contain a method with the following signature:
 *         public static String mailingLabel(String str, String del)

         * str.split(del) splits the string (str) with the delimiter (del).
         * String.join("\n", stringArray) lets us join (stringArray), with the delimiter "\n".
         * With these two methods, we have made an ultra hard assignment into an EZPZ 1 liner! Mwahahaha!
         * Another solution I found was:
         *     return str.replaceAll(del, "\n")
         * That solution is shorter, and cleaner, but I decided to stick with my original solution, cuz it's still cool.
         * 
         * The original code didn't work for parens, because String.split, and String.replaceAll use Regex.
         * Regex breaks really easily.
         * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15236108/groovy-java-split-string-on-parentheses
         * To solve this, I just replaced (del) with (Pattern.quote(del)).

/* It's always better to have way too many comments than none.
 * 
 * I've gotten weak, and used to Javascript's ezpz type conversion. 
 * 
 * Sometimes I mix up syntax from multiple languages. Like String to Number type conversion is way different.
 * JS would be like: +num
 * while Java is   : (int)num
 * and even then, there's all types of weird problems. Java is more reliable, though.
