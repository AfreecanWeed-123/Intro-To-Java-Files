 *     (Zinnformatics) 28 POINTS
 *         Zinnformatics Products, Inc. is selling a web-design software package that retails for $99.00. Quantity discounts are given according to the following table:
 *     
 *         Quantity Discount
 *             10-19 20%
 *             20-49 30%
 *             50-99 40%
 *             100 or more 50%
 *     
 *         Write a Java program that performs the following tasks:
 *             * Have the user input the company name.
 *             * Have the user input the number of packages that they would like to order.
 *             * Output a final "invoice" through a message box, using the format indicated in the sample below:
 *                 - "Thank you for your order Great Neck South High School! You have ordered 40 packages, at a 30% discount. Your final cost will be $2772.00."
 *             * Note: Keep in mind that the dollar value should be formatted, according to the above example.
 *     
 *     Your program must contain methods with the following signatures:
 *         public static double zinnformatics(int quantity) //returns cost
 *         public static double discount(int quantity) //return decimal value, not percent
